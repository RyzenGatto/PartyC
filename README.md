Simple C program to calculate how many pizzas I need and how much it'll cost

Simple code, just input your variables at the start of the program and after Friday and Saturday outputs. The script does not accept inputs after the weekend total.

## C-Odd Digits

The program takes an input between 10 and 99 (inclusive) and decrements until both place value numbers are odd.
